0,/generated_data/train/TLP_0000.wav,266496,And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with No no no I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor
1,/generated_data/train/TLP_0001.wav,148224,A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature and an elephant is very cumbersome
2,/generated_data/train/TLP_0002.wav,58368,Where I live everything is very small
3,/generated_data/train/TLP_0003.wav,52992,What I need is a sheep
4,/generated_data/train/TLP_0004.wav,26112,Draw me a sheep
5,/generated_data/train/TLP_0005.wav,65280,So then I made a drawing
6,/generated_data/train/TLP_0006.wav,83712,He looked at it carefully then he said No
7,/generated_data/train/TLP_0007.wav,51456,This sheep is already very sickly
8,/generated_data/train/TLP_0008.wav,36096,Make me another
9,/generated_data/train/TLP_0010.wav,72960,My friend smiled gently and indulgently
10,/generated_data/train/TLP_0011.wav,84480,You see yourself he said that this is not a sheep
11,/generated_data/train/TLP_0012.wav,36864,This is a ram
12,/generated_data/train/TLP_0013.wav,29184,It has horns
13,/generated_data/train/TLP_0014.wav,81408,So then I did my drawing over once more
14,/generated_data/train/TLP_0016.wav,37632,This one is too old
15,/generated_data/train/TLP_0017.wav,92928,I want a sheep that will live a long time
16,/generated_data/train/TLP_0019.wav,43008,So I tossed off this drawing
17,/generated_data/train/TLP_0020.wav,104448,And I threw out an explanation with it
18,/generated_data/train/TLP_0021.wav,49152,This is only his box
19,/generated_data/train/TLP_0023.wav,412416,I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge That is exactly the way I wanted it Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass Why Because where I live everything is very small
20,/generated_data/train/TLP_0025.wav,89088,It is a very small sheep that I have given you
21,/generated_data/train/TLP_0028.wav,105216,It took me a long time to learn where he came from
22,/generated_data/train/TLP_0030.wav,165120,It was from words dropped by chance that little by little everything was revealed to me
23,/generated_data/train/TLP_0031.wav,317952,The first time he saw my air-plane for instance I shall not draw my air-plane that would be much too complicated for me he asked me What is that object That is not an object
24,/generated_data/train/TLP_0032.wav,33024,It flies
25,/generated_data/train/TLP_0034.wav,53760,It is my air-plane
26,/generated_data/train/TLP_0036.wav,143616,He cried out then What You dropped down from the sky Yes I answered modestly
27,/generated_data/train/TLP_0037.wav,217344,Oh That is funny And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter which irritated me very much
28,/generated_data/train/TLP_0038.wav,86016,I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously
29,/generated_data/train/TLP_0039.wav,412416,Then he added So you too come from the sky Which is your planet At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence and I demanded abruptly Do you come from another planet But he did not reply
30,/generated_data/train/TLP_0040.wav,237312,He tossed his head gently without taking his eyes from my plane It is true that on that you cant have come from very far away
31,/generated_data/train/TLP_0041.wav,90624,And he sank into a reverie which lasted a long time
32,/generated_data/train/TLP_0042.wav,175872,Then taking my sheep out of his pocket he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure
33,/generated_data/train/TLP_0045.wav,457728,My little man where do you come from What is this where I live of which you speak Where do you want to take your sheep After a reflective silence he answered The thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he can use it as his house
34,/generated_data/train/TLP_0046.wav,19968,That is so
35,/generated_data/train/TLP_0047.wav,261888,And if you are good I will give you a string too so that you can tie him during the day and a post to tie him to
36,/generated_data/train/TLP_0049.wav,154368,My friend broke into another peal of laughter But where do you think he would go Anywhere
