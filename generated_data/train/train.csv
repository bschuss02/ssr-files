/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0004.wav,404012,after that they are not able to move and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0005.wav,165932,i pondered deeply then over the adventures of the jungle
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0006.wav,342572,and after some work with a coloured pencil i succeeded in making my first drawing
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0008.wav,364076,it looked like this i showed my masterpiece to the grownups and asked them whether the drawing frightened them
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0012.wav,129068,they always need to have things explained
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0013.wav,826412,my drawing number two looked like this the grownups response this time was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors whether from the inside or the outside and devote myself instead to geography history arithmetic and grammar
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0014.wav,359468,that is why at the age of six i gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0015.wav,313388,i had been disheartened by the failure of my drawing number one and my drawing number two
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0017.wav,248876,so then i chose another profession and learned to pilot airplanes
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0018.wav,476204,i have flown a little over all parts of the world and it is true that geography has been very useful to me
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0019.wav,185900,at a glance i can distinguish china from arizona
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0020.wav,162860,if one gets lost in the night such knowledge is valuable
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0021.wav,445484,in the course of this life i have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0022.wav,210476,i have lived a great deal among grownups
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0023.wav,136748,i have seen them intimately close at hand
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0024.wav,208940,and that hasnt much improved my opinion of them
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0026.wav,231980,i would try to find out so if this was a person of true understanding
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0027.wav,227372,but whoever it was he or she would always say that is a hat
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0028.wav,348716,then i would never talk to that person about boa constrictors or primeval forests or stars
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0029.wav,116780,i would bring myself down to his level
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0030.wav,238124,i would talk to him about bridge and golf and politics and neckties
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0031.wav,228908,and the grownup would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0033.wav,150572,something was broken in my engine
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0034.wav,431660,and as i had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers i set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0036.wav,307244,the first night then i went to sleep on the sand a thousand miles from any human habitation
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0037.wav,265772,i was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0038.wav,374828,thus you can imagine my amazement at sunrise when i was awakened by an odd little voice
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0039.wav,391724,it said if you please draw me a sheep what draw me a sheep i jumped to my feet completely thunderstruck
