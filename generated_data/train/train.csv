/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0000.wav,235776,and i was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with no no no i do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0003.wav,48384,what i need is a sheep
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0005.wav,57600,so then i made a drawing
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0006.wav,93696,he looked at it carefully then he said no
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0008.wav,28416,make me another
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0009.wav,76032,so i made another drawing
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0010.wav,72960,my friend smiled gently and indulgently
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0011.wav,118272,you see yourself he said that this is not a sheep
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0012.wav,29952,this is a ram
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0013.wav,41472,it has horns
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0014.wav,86016,so then i did my drawing over once more
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0015.wav,95232,but it was rejected too just like the others
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0016.wav,42240,this one is too old
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0017.wav,76032,i want a sheep that will live a long time
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0018.wav,205056,by this time my patience was exhausted because i was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0019.wav,72192,so i tossed off this drawing
