1,/content/generated_data/TLP_0001.wav,180480,A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature and an elephant is very cumbersome
2,/content/generated_data/TLP_0002.wav,91392,Where I live everything is very small
3,/content/generated_data/TLP_0003.wav,31488,What I need is a sheep
4,/content/generated_data/TLP_0004.wav,39936,Draw me a sheep

6,/content/generated_data/TLP_0006.wav,77568,He looked at it carefully then he said No
7,/content/generated_data/TLP_0007.wav,49920,This sheep is already very sickly
8,/content/generated_data/TLP_0008.wav,23808,Make me another
9,/content/generated_data/TLP_0009.wav,44544,So I made another drawing
10,/content/generated_data/TLP_0010.wav,92928,My friend smiled gently and indulgently
11,/content/generated_data/TLP_0011.wav,92928,You see yourself he said that this is not a sheep
12,/content/generated_data/TLP_0012.wav,29952,This is a ram
13,/content/generated_data/TLP_0013.wav,43776,It has horns
14,/content/generated_data/TLP_0014.wav,106752,So then I did my drawing over once more
15,/content/generated_data/TLP_0015.wav,64512,But it was rejected too just like the others
16,/content/generated_data/TLP_0016.wav,47616,This one is too old
17,/content/generated_data/TLP_0017.wav,88320,I want a sheep that will live a long time
18,/content/generated_data/TLP_0018.wav,183552,By this time my patience was exhausted because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart
19,/content/generated_data/TLP_0019.wav,55296,So I tossed off this drawing
20,/content/generated_data/TLP_0020.wav,77568,And I threw out an explanation with it
21,/content/generated_data/TLP_0021.wav,43008,This is only his box

23,/content/generated_data/TLP_0023.wav,466176,I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge That is exactly the way I wanted it Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass Why Because where I live everything is very small
24,/content/generated_data/TLP_0024.wav,91392,There will surely be enough grass for him I said
25,/content/generated_data/TLP_0025.wav,90624,It is a very small sheep that I have given you
26,/content/generated_data/TLP_0026.wav,182784,He bent his head over the drawing Not so small that Look He has gone to sleep
27,/content/generated_data/TLP_0027.wav,119808,And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince
28,/content/generated_data/TLP_0028.wav,100608,It took me a long time to learn where he came from
