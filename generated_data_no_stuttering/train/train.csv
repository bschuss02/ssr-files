/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0000.wav,345644,once when i was six years old i saw a magnificent picture in a book called true stories from nature about the primeval forest
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0001.wav,212012,it was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0002.wav,95276,here is a copy of the drawing
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0003.wav,179756,in the book it said boa constrictors swallow their prey whole without chewing it
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0004.wav,313388,after that they are not able to move and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0005.wav,150572,i pondered deeply then over the adventures of the jungle
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0006.wav,239660,and after some work with a coloured pencil i succeeded in making my first drawing
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0008.wav,311852,it looked like this i showed my masterpiece to the grownups and asked them whether the drawing frightened them
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0009.wav,267308,but they answered frighten why should any one be frightened by a hat my drawing was not a picture of a hat
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0010.wav,119852,it was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0011.wav,434732,but since the grown ups were not able to understand it i made another drawing i drew the inside of the boa constrictor so that the grownups could see it clearly
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0012.wav,133676,they always need to have things explained
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0013.wav,761900,my drawing number two looked like this the grownups response this time was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors whether from the inside or the outside and devote myself instead to geography history arithmetic and grammar
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0014.wav,261164,that is why at the age of six i gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0015.wav,270380,i had been disheartened by the failure of my drawing number one and my drawing number two
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0016.wav,430124,grownups never understand anything by themselves and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0017.wav,201260,so then i chose another profession and learned to pilot airplanes
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0018.wav,311852,i have flown a little over all parts of the world and it is true that geography has been very useful to me
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0019.wav,141356,at a glance i can distinguish china from arizona
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0021.wav,373292,in the course of this life i have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0023.wav,138284,i have seen them intimately close at hand
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0025.wav,379436,whenever i met one of them who seemed to me at all clearsighted i tried the experiment of showing him my drawing number one which i have always kept
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0026.wav,201260,i would try to find out so if this was a person of true understanding
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0027.wav,167468,but whoever it was he or she would always say that is a hat
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0028.wav,259628,then i would never talk to that person about boa constrictors or primeval forests or stars
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0030.wav,231980,i would talk to him about bridge and golf and politics and neckties
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0031.wav,201260,and the grownup would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0033.wav,96812,something was broken in my engine
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0034.wav,316460,and as i had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers i set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0035.wav,281132,it was a question of life or death for me i had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0038.wav,271916,thus you can imagine my amazement at sunrise when i was awakened by an odd little voice
/content/generated_data/train/TLP_0039.wav,354860,it said if you please draw me a sheep what draw me a sheep i jumped to my feet completely thunderstruck
